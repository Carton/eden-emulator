## About this fork

This repository is my personal, PC-focused build of Eden, based on Eden's `master` branch.
Most of the work here is a series of performance-optimization experiments driven by a single
game — *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* — profiled and validated on the
Windows/Vulkan desktop build.

Main areas of improvement:

- **CPU (dynarmic JIT)**: a process-wide cross-core shared IR cache (eliminating 51% of
  duplicate block compiles) and constant-time value lookup in register allocation.
- **GPU thread (serial path)**: redundant per-draw address translations, register writes,
  LRU touches and buffer re-resolutions removed; graphics-pipeline lookup memoization.
- **Presentation timing**: a 1200 Hz vsync scheduling floor for unlocked framerate —
  sub-millisecond present quantization without saturating a core.
- **Correctness fixes**: async ASTC decode-window corruption, pause-menu pacing,
  a nondeterministic settings-save crash, and more.

Full design notes and validation data: [OPTIMIZATIONS.md](./OPTIMIZATIONS.md) (English) /
[OPTIMIZATIONS_zh.md](./OPTIMIZATIONS_zh.md)（中文）。

Nearly all of the optimization work was carried out by AI agents — Zcode driving the
workflow with GLM-5.3 as the primary analysis/optimization model, and Codex reviewing
parts of the code. See OPTIMIZATIONS.md for details of how the loop ran.

## Compatibility

The emulator is capable of running most commercial games at full speed, provided you meet the necessary hardware requirements.

A list of supported games will be available in future. Please be patient.
